    <p>As a Customer Service Representative, we recently had to develop a new system for obtaining signatures to release liability waivers related to the COVID precautions. Since we had to collect all new waivers from each individual participating in the various programs at the aquatics center, our management also implemented an online form to allow customers to sign the waiver via a personal computer or mobile phone. Unfortunately, Gmail’s user interface is not very efficient for combing through 2000+ emails for valid signatures. Instead of going through the emails each day and manually entering data into a spreadsheet, I developed a low-security python application that connects to the RBAC email address and filters out each participant’s name, the parent/guardian, and the date the signature was collected. This program has helped us improve our productivity and eased our workload.
